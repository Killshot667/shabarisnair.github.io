- Application for training intelligent agents for the popular Snake Game, where the agent becomes longer upon each apple eaterhas the aim of eating as many apples before it touches itself or the boundary
- Investigated two methods - Deep Q Learning (Reinforcement Learning) and Genetic Algorithm for training the agents.
- Attained a high score of 95 in just 40 generations using Genetic Algorithm and a score of 79 in about 100 games using RL
- UI using Pygame for continuous monitoring of the agent during training and playing
