- Interactive tool using pygame that you can run locally to understand and play around with graph search algorithms
- Supports Depth-first, Breadth-first, Dijikastra, and A*
- From the grid, you can choose your starting and ending point and then select the cells where you want to add an obstruction, then click spacebar to run
