title: "Autonomous Bot Simulation Using Image Processing and A* Algorithm"
excerpt: |
  An autonomous bot simulation done using PyBullet for finding the shortest path in a complicated environment, given its live video feed (processed via OpenCV) using the A* graph search algorithm. Team project undertaken as part of Pixelate'22 competition in Technex'22 at IIT BHU

- Autonomous bot simulation done for finding the shortest path in a complicated environment, given its live video feed
- Visual representation of the arena and the bot movements were done using PyBullet
- Image processing techniques using OpenCV were used to manipulate the data, i.e., shape, colour and aruco marker detection in the programmable form
- A* graph search algorithm used to determine the shortest path to reach the destination node
- The program also supports manual override to run the bot
- Team project undertaken as part of Pixelate'22 competition in Technex'22 at IIT BHU
