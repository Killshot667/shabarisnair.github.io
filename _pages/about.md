## A bit about myself  🧑🏻‍💻

- 🔭 I recently graduated with a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology BHU, India, and am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Sprinklr
- 🥅 My interests include theoretical and applied AI, ML Operations, micro-service architectures, algorithms, and web development.
- 🌱 I also find joy in doing puzzles and picking my brain with fun probability questions.
-  😄 In my free time you can find me at my keyboard (the instrument) or glued to fantasy novels and shows.
