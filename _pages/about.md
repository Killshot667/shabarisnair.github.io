## A bit about myself  🧑🏻‍💻
- 🔭 I recently graduated with a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology BHU, India
- ⚡ My interests include Deep Learning, NLP (LLMs), Voice AI systems, Vision Models, and large scale Machine Learning Systems
- 🌲 I am currently working as an AI Product Engineer in the Voice Team at Sprinklr where I engage in both ML Ops and research into the accuracy, generalization, and optimization of speech-to-text and text-to-speech models.
- 🌏 I am experienced in frameworks like Pytorch, as well as microservice management tech like Kubernetes and Docker, having worked on numerous projects to build and deploy scalable and highly optimized AI based solutions for solving real-life problems, especially those in the CXM domain.
- 🌱 I am a quick learner and am always on the lookout for new things to explore in the field of AI/ML, computer science and mathematics.
- 😄 In my free time you can find me at my keyboard (the instrument) or glued to fantasy novels and shows.
