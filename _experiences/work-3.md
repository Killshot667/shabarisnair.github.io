  - Conducted extensive literature survey into single and group human activity recognition (HAR) methods for videos
  - Proposed a keyframe extraction method, achieving a 2% accuracy improvement with 25% fewer frames using activity
  recognition models like SlowFast, R(2+1)D, C3D, and DB-LSTM, during inference on benchmark datasets
  - Integrated the keyframe extraction method into an efficient HAR pipeline consisting of person detection (Yolov7) and
  tracking (StrongSORT), for activity recognition (SlowFast) of individual persons in a surveillance video feed
  - Evaluated the pipeline on a custom-made dataset using the department surveillance cameras

  - Conducted study on the occurance and detection of concept drift in graph streams
  - Analyzed new trends and insights in the application of a SOTA graph stream drift detection technique - Discriminative Subgraph Based Drift Detector (DSDD), to gradual and abrupt concept drifts present in graph stream data in the domain of toxicology
  - Proved the impact of drift detection in toxicology datasets by obtaining a 27% boost in graph classification accuracy
  when adapting a new LSTM-based graph classification model to the detected drifts, compared to when not adapted
