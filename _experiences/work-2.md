- Trained and deployed the first multilingual TTS model which is the primary inhouse TTS currently being used.
- Core member of the Voice Research team where I worked on problems like contextual biasing in ASR systems, zero-shot adaption
of ASR using prompting, and confidence estimation, and published papers in the same.
