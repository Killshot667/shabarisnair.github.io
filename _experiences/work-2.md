  - Worked on optimization and maintainance of deployment pipelines of Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
  Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) services.
  - Developed a novel prompting-based technique for contextual biasing in Whisper, improving WER over the baseline by
  45.6% for rare words and 60.8% for out-of-vocab words, with generalization to unseen languages as well
  - Modified and fine-tuned the Whisper architecture to act as an end-to-end, largely model-independent word-level
  confidence estimator, outperforming previous SOTA on out-of-domain datasets and unseen languages
  - Spearheaded the ASR latency optimization track and implemented techniques like quantization, speculative decoding,
  flash attention, and custom inference engines to improve the model latency by 3x
  - Implemented infrastructural solutions to bring down the latency of streaming speech recognition service by 50%
  - Owned the bulk of Text-to-Speech (TTS) client deployments (70+), including their maintainance, bug fixes, and alerts
  - Developed internal demoing tool for clients to test Sprinklr TTS services

- Worked on optimization and maintainance of deployment pipelines of Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) services.
- Owned the bulk of TTS client deployments (70+), including their maintainance, bug fixes, and alerts.
- Trained and deployed the first multilingual TTS model which is the primary inhouse TTS currently being used.
- Core member of the Voice Research team where I worked on problems like contextual biasing in ASR systems, zero-shot adaption
of ASR using prompting, and confidence estimation, and published papers in the same [[paper 1]](https://killshot667.github.io/shabarisnair.github.io/publication/2024-06-30-conference-1), [[paper 2]](https://killshot667.github.io/shabarisnair.github.io/publication/2024-09-12-conference-2)
- Spearheaded the ASR latency optimization track and implemented infrastructural solutions to boost latency of existing models by 3-4x.
- Peformed independent research on streaming speech recognition to bring down the latency of prior solution by 50%.
