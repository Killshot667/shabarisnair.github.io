Whisper, despite being trained on 680K hours of web-scaled audio data, faces difficulty in recognizing rare words like domain-specific terms, with a solution being contextual bias- ing through prompting. To improve upon this method, in this
paper, we propose a supervised learning strategy to fine-tune Whisper for contextual biasing instruction. We demonstrate that by using only 670 hours of Common Voice English set for fine-tuning, our model generalizes to 11 diverse open- source English datasets, achieving a 45.6% improvement in recognition of rare words and 60.8% improvement in recognition of words unseen during fine-tuning over the baseline method. Surprisingly, our modelâ€™s contextual biasing ability generalizes even to languages unseen during fine-tuning.
